## Project Overview
This project aims to simplify the car importation inquiry process in Kenya by providing
an accurate cost estimation tool. It factors in taxes, import duties, and additional
fees using data from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). The system will allow users to
input car details and instantly receive a breakdown of total costs, eliminating the guesswork
involved in vehicle importation.
